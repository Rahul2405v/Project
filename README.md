# CO2 Prediction of Countries Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project aims to predict CO2 emissions of various countries using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, and deploying a Flask application for serving predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - flask

You can install the required packages using pip:


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn flask


### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahul2405v/Project.git
   ```

2. **Download the Dataset**

   Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `modelbuilding` folder present in the `Project Executable Files` directory. [https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashukr/exploring-co2-emission/input?select=Indicators.csv]

### Running the Project

1. **Execute the Cells**

   Navigate to the `modelbuilding` folder and open the Jupyter notebook provided. Run each cell sequentially. This will generate three `.pkl` files.

2. **Place Generated Files**

   Move the generated `.pkl` files to the `Flask files` folder present in the `Project Executable Files` directory.

3. **Run the Flask Application**

   Navigate to the `Project Executable Files` directory and run the Flask application
